# pytroll-examples

Pytroll examples showcase various features in Pytroll packages like satpy, pyresample, and pyspectral. These packages are typically used for processing earth-observing satellite data.

## Interactive Examples

These examples can be run from a live Binder/JupyterHub environment.

## Data Access

Some examples depend on input data that is not publicly available or has not been compiled in to a single download source. This is being slowly fixed as solutions are discovered for easily accessing those instruments' data over the internet.
